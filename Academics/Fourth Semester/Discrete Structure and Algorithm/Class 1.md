### Miscellaneous

- Algorithm + Data structure = Program

### Need of data structure 

- DS modification is easy 
- It requires less time 
- Save Storage Memory space 
- Data representation is easy 
- Easy access to the large database

### Characteristics and Types

 1. Correctness 
	 Correctness means that the algorithm always produces the expected output or follows the ground truth for the range of valid inputs and eventually terminates it. 
	 There are two types of correctness:
	 - partial correctness 
		An algorithm that 
	 - total correctness
	
	 
 2. Space complexity
 3. Time complexity
