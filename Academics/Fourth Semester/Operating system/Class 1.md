chat# Introduction 

### Monolithic Kernel

Apart from micro-kernel, ***Monolithic Kernel*** is another classification of Kernel. Like micro-kernel, this one also manages system resources between application and hardware, but ***user*** and ***kernel services*** are implemented under the same address space. It increases the size of the kernel, thus increasing the size of the operating system as well.  This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other operating system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, the operating system execution is faster. 

## What is a Monolithic Kernel?

A monolithic kernel is an operating system kernel in which all the operating system services run in kernel space, meaning they all share the same memory space. This type of kernel is characterized by its tight integration of system services and its high performance.

Below is the diagrammatic representation of the Monolithic Kernel:

### ***Advantages of Monolithic Kernel***

- One of the major advantages of having a monolithic kernel is that it provides [CPU scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/), [memory management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/), file management, and other operating system functions through [system calls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/).
- The other one is that it is a single large process running entirely in a single address space.
- It is a single static binary file. Examples of some Monolithic Kernel-based OSs are Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400, z/TPF.
- No need for complex inter-process communication (IPC), which speeds up system call execution.

### ***Disadvantages of Monolithic Kernel***

- ***Stability Issues***: One of the major disadvantages of a monolithic kernel is that if anyone service fails it leads to an entire system failure.
- ***Lack of Modularity***: If the user has to add any new service. The user needs to modify the entire [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/).
- ***Security Risks***: A bug or vulnerability in any service can affect the entire system since all services run in kernel mode.
- ***Large Size***: The kernel can become very large and complex as more services are added.

## What is micro-kernel?

A micro-kernel is a type of operating system kernel in which only the most basic services run in kernel space, with other services running in user space. This type of kernel is characterized by its modularity, simplicity, and ability to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware. 

The micro-kernel itself typically includes only the most fundamental services, such as:

- ***Inter-process Communication (IPC)***: Mechanisms for processes to communicate and [synchronize](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) with each other.
- ***Basic Scheduling***: Managing the execution of processes.
- ***Minimal Memory Management***: Essential functions for memory allocation and protection.

Other functionalities that are often part of a monolithic kernel, like [device drivers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/device-driver-and-its-purpose/), file systems, and network protocols, are implemented in user space as separate processes. This contrasts with a monolithic kernel, where all these services run in kernel space.

## Kernel Space vs User Space

Before comparing types of kernels, it’s important to know whether components run in kernel space or user space, as this impacts how the system works.

In an operating system, there are two main areas where code runs: user space and kernel space. **User space is where user applications run, while kernel space is where the operating system and other important parts run**. In kernel space, code can directly access system resources like memory and hardware, allowing it to perform special tasks that user space code can’t.

System calls are important for connecting user space and kernel space. They let user applications ask the kernel for specific services. When an application makes a system call, it switches from user space to kernel space, allowing the kernel to do what the application requested.

## Key Differences Between Monolithic and Micro Kernel

- **System Services:** In a monolithic kernel, all system services run in kernel space, whereas in a micro-kernel, only the most basic services (such as memory management and process scheduling) run in kernel space, with other services running in user space.
- **Performance:** Monolithic kernels are generally faster and more efficient than micro-kernels, because there is no overhead associated with moving data between kernel space and user space.
- **Modularity:** micro-kernels are more modular than monolithic kernels, because services are separated into different processes running in user space. This makes it easier to add or remove services without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Security:** micro-kernels are generally considered more secure than monolithic kernels, because a bug or vulnerability in a service running in user space is less likely to affect the entire system.
- **Development:** Developing a monolithic kernel is generally simpler and faster than developing a micro-kernel, because all system services are integrated and share the same memory space.

| **Security**              | If the service crashes then there is no effect on working on the micro-kernel. | If the process/service crashes, the whole system crashes as both user and OS were in the same address space. |
| **Code**                  | More code is required to write a micro-kernel.                                 | Less code is required to write a monolithic kernel.                                                          |

| **Security**              | More secure because only essential services run in kernel mode                 | Susceptible to security vulnerabilities due to the amount of code running in kernel mode                     |
| **Platform independence** | More portable because most drivers and services run in user space              | Less portable due to direct hardware access                                                                  |

## Conclusion

In summary, [monolithic kernels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monolithic-architecture/) are characterized by their tight integration of system services and high performance, while [micro-kernels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/micro-kernel-in-operating-systems/) are characterized by their modularity, simplicity, and security. The choice between a monolithic and micro-kernel architecture depends on the specific needs and requirements of the operating system being developed.

# Layered Operating System

Layered Structure is a type of system structure in which the different services of the [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/) are split into various layers, where each layer has a specific well-defined task to perform. It was created to improve the pre-existing structures like the Monolithic structure ( UNIX ) and the Simple structure ( MS-DOS ). **Example –** The Windows NT operating system uses this layered approach as a part of it. **Design Analysis :** The whole Operating System is separated into several layers ( from 0 to n ) as the diagram shows. Each of the layers must have its own specific function to perform. There are some rules in the implementation of the layers as follows.

1. The outermost layer must be the User Interface layer.
2. The innermost layer must be the Hardware layer.
3. A particular layer can access all the layers present below it but it cannot access the layers present above it. That is layer n-1 can access all the layers from n-2 to 0 but it cannot access the nth layer.

Thus if the user layer wants to interact with the hardware layer, the response will be traveled through all the layers from n-1 to 1. Each layer must be designed and implemented such that it will need only the services provided by the layers below it.

Layered OS Design

**Advantages :**

There are several advantages to this design :

1. **Modularity :** This design promotes modularity as each layer performs only the tasks it is scheduled to perform.
2. **Easy debugging :** As the layers are discrete so it is very easy to debug. Suppose an error occurs in the CPU scheduling layer, so the developer can only search that particular layer to debug, unlike the Monolithic system in which all the services are present together.
3. **Easy update :** A modification made in a particular layer will not affect the other layers.
4. **No direct access to hardware :** The hardware layer is the innermost layer present in the design. So a user can use the services of hardware but cannot directly modify or access it, unlike the Simple system in which the user had direct access to the hardware.
5. **Abstraction :** Every layer is concerned with its own functions. So the functions and implementations of the other layers are abstract to it.

**Disadvantages :**

Though this system has several advantages over the Monolithic and Simple design, there are also some disadvantages as follows.

1. **Complex and careful implementation :** As a layer can access the services of the layers below it, so the arrangement of the layers must be done carefully. For example, the backing storage layer uses the services of the memory management layer. So it must be kept below the memory management layer. Thus with great modularity comes complex implementation.
2. **Slower in execution :** If a layer wants to interact with another layer, it sends a request that has to travel through all the layers present in between the two interacting layers. Thus it increases response time, unlike the Monolithic system which is faster than this. Thus an increase in the number of layers may lead to a very inefficient design.

## Kernel

A **kernel** is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system that always has complete control over everything in the system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. A full kernel controls all hardware resources (e.g. I/O, memory, cryptography) via device drivers, arbitrates conflicts between processes concerning such resources, and optimizes the use of common resources, such as CPU, cache, file systems, and network sockets. On most systems, the kernel is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the boot-loader). It handles the rest of startup as well as memory, peripherals, and input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit.
