## Introduction

Electromagnetics is the branch of physics that studies the interactions between electrically charges particles and their associated field. These interactions are described in the terms of electric and magnetic field which together form the electromagnetic force.

### Static charge

It produces an electric field which exerts forces on the other charges in its vicinity. 
- Attraction / Repulsion 
- Discharge
- Electrostatic induction : Can induce electricity without direct contact.

### Dynamic charge

- It produces both electrical field and magnetic field.
- Moving charges are source of electromagnetism.
